	volume = {84},
	abstract = {A strong socio-economic development pressure in South Chile will more and more cause an impact to the present lakes and rivers. Nevertheless, our knowledge concerning the ecological structure and the microbial self-puriﬁcation capabilities of these lacustrine water bodies is scant but essential for a future sustainable development of land and water use. We studied Lake Laja, a lake already heavily impacted by water diversions for hydropower generation and irrigation. Typical for the Andean region Lake Laja is an oligotrophic water body, limited by nitrogen nutrients. Only very low chlorophyll a and particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations and a small abundance and biomass of bacteria (mainly ultramicrobacteria) and heterotrophic ﬂagellates were encountered. Weak trophic interrelations were derived from a high bacteria-to-heterotrophic ﬂagellate ratio. For the ten investigated extracellular enzymes (alkaline phosphatase, leucine-, arginine-, glycine- and tyrosine-aminopeptidase, α-, β-D-glucosidase, α-, β-D-galactosidase, N-acetylβ-D-glucosaminidase), with the exception of α-D-glucosidase, a broad range of organic matter degradation activities was proven. Probably, due to the N-limitation, organic nitrogen hydrolysing extracellular enzymes reached activities on average of 45 \% compared to other studies in oligotrophic waters. The possible effect of N-limitation on extracellular enzyme activities was more pronounced by cell speciﬁc extracellular enzymatic activity rates, which exceeded those of other oligotrophic water bodies on average by factor 2. The overall activities of all microbial extracellular enzymes studied proved to be dominated by the dissolved free external enzymes (up to 98 \%) over the ectoenzymes which are associated with particulate organic matter (bacterial cell walls, particles, and aggregates). It is concluded that future socio-economic changes, dealing with watershed human intervention (accelerating inorganic and organic loads) as well as global change (temperature and precipitation changes) could lead to signiﬁcant changes in the ecology of Lake Laja.},

	abstract = {Water and sediment quality in North Patagonia’s large, oligotrophic lakes are expected to suffer as native forest continues to be fragmented and degraded by its conversion to cropping and pasture land uses. These changes in land use are expected to increase diffuse nutrient loads to the region’s lakes. In addition, these lakes are home to the world’s second largest salmon aquaculture industry which provides additional point sources of nutrients within the lakes. We studied the combined inﬂuences of land use change and salmon farming on the nutrient concentrations in a North Patagonian lake (Lake Rupanco, 233 km2 water surface, 163 m average depth) in four sub-watersheds ranging in disturbance from nearpristine forest to 53\% converted to cropping and pasture. Nitrogen exports from the tributary subwatersheds increased from 33 kg TN/km2/y to 621 kg TN/km2/y as the proportion of crop and pasture land increased. The combined nutrient load from land use change and salmon farming has led to signiﬁcant differences in the nitrogen concentrations of the lake’s water column and sediments in the nearshore zones across the lake. Total nitrogen concentrations in the sediments varied from 37 Æ 18 mg/kg in near-pristine sub-watersheds without salmon farming to 6400 Æ 698 mg/kg where the sub-watershed was dominated by crop and pasture lands combined with the presence of salmon farming. These results demonstrate the importance of considering the impacts of both salmon farming and land use on water and sediment quality for future environmental planning, management and decision making.},

              The aim of our study was to evaluate the abundance of cyanobacteria and microcystins in four Sardinian reservoirs (Italy) characterised by different trophic status to define a reference picture for future changes. Increasing levels of eutrophication and the abundance of cyanobacteria are expected to occur due to climate change, especially in the southern Mediterranean. Consequently, an in-depth study of the occurrence of harmful cyanobacteria is important to develop appropriate management strategies for water resources at a local scale. Monthly samples were collected at one station in each reservoir over an 18-month period. The Analysis of similarity indicated that cyanobacterial abundance and species composition differed significantly among the reservoirs. The Redundancy analysis highlighted their relationship to trophic, hydrological and seasonal patterns. Spearman’s analysis indicated that there were significant correlations among the most important species (

	abstract = {The Chilean lake district includes diverse lentic ecosystems along ca. 700 km of the country (361–431S), including the ‘‘Nahuelbutan lakes’’, ‘‘Araucanian lakes’’ and ‘‘Chiloe lakes’’. This area is recognized as an important ‘‘hot spot’’ of benthic freshwater biodiversity in Southern South America. In Chilean temperate lakes, increased nutrient loads of P and N caused eutrophication, particularly in the Nahuelbutan Lakes. The freshwater Hyriidae mussel Diplodon chilensis (Gray, 1828) which is one of the most abundant species in Chilean temperate lakes, is known to be very susceptible to eutrophication. This species presents a clear reduction in its geographic ranges and is considered to be a threatened species in many Chilean lakes. In this study, we used a correlative approach to determine how eutrophication-driven changes in the food supply and in geographical parameters of different Chilean lakes affected the shell growth rates of D. chilensis. The results obtained from sclerochronological analyses of the mussel shells suggest an association with a group of environmental variables, including geographical types (negative), such as latitude and altitude, and limnological types (positive), especially phosphorous and turbidity. However, the D. chilensis populations under extreme conditions of turbidity in eutrophic and hypertrophic lakes are extinct or nearly so. The high positive correlation of the mean D. chilensis growth rates with orthophosphate (R ¼ 0.76; Po0.05), in relation to dissolved inorganic nitrogen, suggests that P is the major limiting factor of the primary productivity in Chilean temperate lakes. We discuss some implications of our results in terms of the conservation of biodiversity in temperate lake ecosystems at different taxonomic levels.},

Nitrogen isotope ratios were measured on organic matter accumulation in sediment traps, collected daily from March 1995 through October 1996, and on individually sampled light and dark annual laminae from a 108-yr sediment core sequence (1885–1993). Nitrogen accumulation in the sediment traps averaged 0.04 g N mϪ2 dϪ1. ␦15N values of the sediment trap material increased from 11‰ to 13‰ (atmospheric N2) as primary productivity decreased surface water [NO3Ϫ] from 1.4 to 0.7 mg N LϪ1 during the seasonal stratiﬁed periods. Very small amounts of isotopically enriched organic matter (␦15N ϳ 15–20‰) of heterotrophic and/or detrital origin accumulated in the winter months.},

Under calculated conditions for pH(total scale) and pCO2 ranging from 7.73–8.66 to 69.7–721.3 latm, respectively, the Chilean strain Q09 presented an optimum growth rate and dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) uptake at near-equilibrium pCO2/pH conditions (\$8.1). DistaLM analysis between physiological relevant carbonate system parameters (CO2, HCOÀ3 , and Hþ) and cellular rates (growth rate and DIC uptake) identiﬁed HCOÀ3 as the unique variable explaining a signiﬁcant portion of the physiological response. Estimations of equivalent spherical diameter (ESD) and chain-formation index (CI) revealed reduced cell size and enhanced chain formation at high pH/low pCO2 conditions. Light intensity as co-factor during experiments (50 vs. 100 lmol photons mÀ2 sÀ1) produced no effect on ESD and CI. Cells exposed to low light; however, had reduced cell growth and DIC uptake especially at high pH/low pCO2. We suggest that A. catenella Chilean strains are highly adapted to spatio-temporal pCO2/pH ﬂuctuations in Chilean fjords, becoming a resilient winner from expected climate change effects.},

	abstract = {The mechanisms which controls the fixation and/or release of P in sediment of an extremely acidic lake (pH = 2.0 to 3.0) and its response to the influence of eutrophic urban waste water were investigated. The results, in the chemical composition, in the mineralogy of the sediment and in the material as obtained from sediment traps, show that the lake sediments are mainly volcanic material reflecting volcanic features of the basin. The sedimentation rate calculated for the lake (2.5 u 10-2 mg m-2 day-1) was higher than that observed in other similar glacial lakes in both Andean Patagonia and also elsewhere in the world. The Total Phosphorus concentration in sediments was higher than figures reported by other authors for mining acid lakes, and the main fraction of P was found associated with organic matter. There was no control by Fe or Al on P, because both are in solution at pH {\textless} 3.0. It was concluded that changes in the natural input of nutrients (derivatives of Copahue volcano fluid, the discharge of sewage, or basin run-off) are responsible for a high concentration of SRP and N-NH4+ in the lake. Laboratory experiments showed that sediments have no ability to retain phosphorus and a continuous release of P from the sediments into the water column was observed. The assays where the pH was artificially increased showed that the P still remains in solution until at least pH 7.0. It was concluded that changes in the natural input of nutrients due to: 1) the volcanic fluids, 2) the increase in sewage charges, or 3) surface runoff upstream, maintain a high trophic state with high concentrations of dissolved P and N-NH4+, although the threshold of neutral pH in the lake is exceeded. This study will enable a better understanding about of the mechanism of release/fixation of phosphorus in acidic sediments in order to assist in making decisions regarding the conservation and management of this natural environment.},

              Warming across the globe is expected to alter the strength and amount of regional precipitation, but there is uncertainty associated with the magnitude of these expected changes, and also how these changes in temperature and the hydrologic cycle will affect humans. For example, the climate in central-south Chile is projected to become significantly warmer and drier over the next several decades in response to anthropogenically driven warming, but these anthropogenic changes are superimposed on natural climate variability. The stable isotope composition of meteoric water provides significant information regarding the moisture source, pathways, and rain-out history of an air mass, but precipitation samples suitable for stable isotope measurements require long-term placement of field equipment making them difficult to obtain. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Global Network of Isotopes in Precipitation (GNIP) stations generate isotopic and ancillary data of precipitation from many locations around the world, but remote areas of developing countries like Chile typically have sparse networks of meteorological stations, which inhibit our ability to accurately model regional precipitation. Central-south Chile, in particular, has a sparse network of GNIP stations and, as a result, the isotopic composition of meteoric water is underrepresented in the global database complicating efforts to constrain modern day hydroclimate variability as well as paleohydrologic reconstruction for southern South America. In this study, we measured the stable isotope compositions of hydrogen (δ
              2
              H) and oxygen (δ

The sediments were exposed to different initial chlorate concentrations in microcosm tests, with and without the addition of acetate as an external electron donor, and in a matrix of natural water or a deﬁned medium. At a high initial chlorate concentration of 100 mg/L, in the absence of an external electron source, the degradation curves presented ﬁrst-order kinetics, inﬂuenced by electron donor availability. The ﬁrst-order kinetic constant varied between 0.05 and 0.17 dayÀ1. Subsequently, when the initial chlorate concentration was reduced to 7 mg/L, a zero-order kinetic was obtained, with the kinetic constant presenting values between 1.1 and 1.3 mg/L-day. No correlation was observed between chlorate degradation kinetics and the location of the sampling points or the previous history of exposure to chlorate. Other factors evaluated, such as the availability of organic matter or the chlorate reducing bacteria count, also proved not to have any incidence on the results. The richness of chlorate reducing bacteria species in the different samples analysed were also similar, with the greatest similarity being found between cld genes in the samples from the upstream or downstream sampling points. Additionally, cld genes most similar to those present in PCRB like Dechlorospirillum sp., Alicycliphilus denitriﬁcans, Dechloromonas agitata, Dechloromonas sp. LT1 and Ideonella dechloratans were detected. This study showed that the anaerobic sediments of the Cruces river wetland present a high potential for chlorate natural attenuation, regardless of the previous history of exposure to chlorate. This capacity is associated with the presence of a diverse community of chlorate reducing bacteria.},

	abstract = {Land-use and land-cover has a relevant role in nutrient ﬂuxes at the watershed scale. Rivers are the natural bridges between terrestrial and aquatic systems where water, nutrients, and sediments, among others, are transferred through land–margin and margin–aquatic interactions. In this regard, it is necessary to gain further understanding of the inﬂuence of land-use and land-cover changes (LULCCs) on aquatic systems characterized by high quality standards but whose watersheds are subject to recent LULCC. In this study, a spatially explicit model (N-SPECT) was applied with the purpose of assessing whether, in southern-central Chile, the recent LULCC could alter the nutrient input to oligotrophic lakes (total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphorus (TP)). We hypothesize that maintaining the LULCC would force a signiﬁcant increase in nutrient inputs, mainly due to deforestation and agricultural expansion into areas of greater slopes and altitudes currently covered by temperate forest. The results showed degradation and deforestation with annual rates of loss of old-growth forest close to 1\%. Similarly, signiﬁcant clearance for agricultural purposes near rivers and coastal areas was noted. This condition will cause an increase in nutrient inputs from tributary rivers, and it is estimated that by 2020, under current LULCC trajectories, the TN loads entering the lake will be 1.11 times higher than those registered in the mid1980s. The results indicate that to preserve and/or restore the quality of aquatic south-central Chilean ecosystems, it is necessary to modify the current LULCC: (1) to fundamentally stop the temperate forest degradation and (2) to regulate the expansion of agricultural land in steeper and higher areas, where important forest still exists.},

            Aquacultures are of great economic importance worldwide but pollute pristine headwater streams, lakes, and estuaries. However, there are no in-depth studies of the consequences of aquacultures on dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition and structure. We performed a detailed molecular level characterization of aquaculture DOM quality and its bacterial degradation using four salmon aquacultures in Chile. Fluorescence measurements, ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the DOM revealed specific and extensive molecular alterations caused by aquacultures. Aquacultures released large quantities of readily bioavailable metabolites (primarily carbohydrates and peptides/proteins, and lipids), causing the organic matter downstream of all the investigated aquacultures to deviate strongly from the highly processed, polydisperse and molecularly heterogeneous DOM found in pristine rivers. However, the upstream individual catchment DOM signatures remained distinguishable at the downstream sites. The benthic algal biovolume decreased and the bacterial biovolume and production increased downstream of the aquacultures, shifting stream ecosystems to a more heterotrophic state and thus impairing the ecosystem health. The bacterial DOM degradation rates explain the attenuation of aquaculture DOM within the subsequent stream reaches. This knowledge may aid the development of improved waste processing facilities and may help to define emission thresholds to protect sensitive stream ecosystems.},

Using data from 89 studies worldwide, we examined responses to the reduction or cessation of anthropogenic nutrient inputs relative to baseline conditions. Baseline conditions were pre-disturbance conditions, undisturbed reference sites, restoration targets, or experimental controls. We estimated recovery completeness (\% baseline conditions reached) and recovery rate (annual \% change relative to baseline conditions) for plant and animal abundance and diversity and for ecosystem functions. Categories were considered fully recovered if the 95\% conﬁdence interval (CI) of recovery completeness overlapped 100\% and partially recovered if the CI did not overlap either 100\% or zero. Cessation of nutrient inputs did not result in more complete or faster recovery than partial nutrient reductions, due likely to insufﬁcient passage of time, nutrients from other sources, or shifting baselines. Together, lakes and coastal marine areas achieved 34\% (616\% CI) and 24\% (615\% CI) of baseline conditions decades after the cessation or partial reduction of nutrients, respectively. One third of individual response variables showed no change or worsened conditions, suggesting that achieving baseline conditions may not be possible in all cases. Implied recovery times after cessation of nutrient inputs varied widely, from {\textless} 1 yr to nearly a century, depending on response. Our results suggest that long-term monitoring is needed to better understand recovery timescales and trajectories and that policy measures must consider the potential for slow and partial recovery.},

We assessed temporal trends in water parameters, and the contribution of land use to the eutrophication of the largest lakes of central-southern Chile. The mean values of water parameters varied seasonally, with lakes Chapo and Caburgua exhibiting lower pH, temperature, and N/P ratio values. Over the assessed period (19 years), we found a temporal reduction in water conductivity and temperature of the lakes. The concentration of NO3-\_N, PO43−–P and dissolved oxygen increased in all the lakes, but pH increased in eight out of the ten lakes. The negative temporal trend in temperature was more pronounced as the depth level increased. Lakes whose basins had a higher percentage of forest plantation and urban areas had larger values of Chlorophyll a and pH, as well as, smaller values of dissolved oxygen. Lakes whose basins included larger percentages of native forest had smaller nutrient (NO3-\_N, PO43−–P) concentrations. Our ﬁndings suggest that decreased rainfall in central-southern Chile due to climate change may cause a decrease of particulate material that is carried by tributaries into the lakes. The observed temporal decrease in temperature, especially at the deeper levels, may be explained by the rapid melting of glaciers. Although the studied lakes are classiﬁed as oligotrophic, deforestation and expansion of urban areas around the lakes have led to increased nutrient input, thus accelerating their eutrophication.},

The capacity of Chile's environmental impact assessment system (SEIA) to evaluate resident freshwater ﬁshes and the potential impacts of water projects and aquaculture activities – two categories of projects that create direct threats to freshwater ﬁshes – are assessed. Of the 3997 such submissions to the SEIA, only 0.6\% conducted any freshwater ﬁsh assessment, and only 0.1\% conducted any quantitative assessment of expected impacts from the associated project. The small number of assessments was characterized by poor study design, inconsistent sampling methodology, and species misidentiﬁcation. Traditional assessments failed to include freshwater ﬁsh ecology in the general assessment framework. The new strategic environmental evaluation system only underscores the need for vastly improved ﬁeld sampling protocols and assessment methodologies.},

	abstract = {To provide evidence of the inadequacy of using conventional sampling methods to study mesozooplankton community structure in conﬁned environments, samples from a Mediterranean meromictic coastal lake were taken using 80-mm and 200-mm mesh nets towed at three different depths (0e18 m). Mesh size signiﬁcantly affected the description of the community structure of the collected zooplankton. The 80-mm-mesh catch revealed for the ﬁrst time in such an environment the overwhelming abundance of the copepod species Oithona brevicornis, as two orders of magnitude greater than recorded for the 200-mm-mesh catch. The other dominant species were Paracartia latisetosa and Pseudodiaptomus marinus, which were more efﬁciently sampled with the 200-mm mesh. These showed a summer abundance peak for P. latisetosa near the surface layer, and for P. marinus in the deepest stratum, close to the anoxic layer. Copepod nauplii and bivalve larvae were more efﬁciently caught with the 80-mm-mesh, and accounted for most of the zooplankton in winter, and showed the highest loss percentage of abundance between the two mesh-size catches. The differences in the assemblages reﬂect different diversity patterns, with peaks in summer and winter for the communities collected with the 80-mm-mesh and 200mm-mesh, respectively. These ﬁndings imply the need for the development of a commonly used sampling method with paired nets, to correctly take into account both the large and small fractions of the mesozooplankton in the study of closed and semi-enclosed coastal environments, and to obtain data that can be better compared across studies.},

The numerical simulation was performed to investigate the inﬂuence range for salinity intrusion when the gates were fully opened. The conditions used for simulation were the four ﬂow regimes in Geum River Basin, Korea. Results indicated that the ranges of salinity intrusion from the barrage were 50.72 km (drought ﬂow), 48.87 km (low ﬂow), 46.56 km (normal ﬂow) and 42.10 km (ﬂood ﬂow). These results indicated that the EFDC model used for numerical simulation has high accuracy.

Bacterial biomass production, which was used as a measure of DOM degradation, was highest in summer, and was usually lower at upstream than at downstream sites. An important proportion of bacterial production was realized in epilithic bioﬁlms. Production of planktonic and bioﬁlm bacteria was related to water temperature. Planktonic production weakly correlated to DOM quality and to total phosphorus concentration. Addition of soluble reactive phosphorus did not stimulate bacterial DOM degradation. Overall, DOM was considerably degraded in summer at low discharge levels, whereas degradation was negligible during ﬂood events (when DOM load in reservoirs was high). The ratio of DOM degradation to total DOM release was negatively related to discharge. On annual average, only 0.6–12\% of total DOM released by the catchments was degraded within the tributaries.},

Therefore, we tested whether Stentor spp. (i) is an important food for juvenile endemic (Cheirodon australe, Galaxias maculatus, Odontesthes mauleanum, Percichthys trucha) and introduced (Oncorhynchus mykiss) ﬁsh species, and (ii) represents a remarkable grazer of bacteria. Ingestion rates of ﬁsh estimated by disappearance of Stentor in feeding experiments ranged between 8 (G. maculatus) and 53 (C. australe) ciliates per ﬁsh and day, and assimilation rates measured by using radioactively labelled Stentor ranged between 3 (P. trucha) and 52 (C. australe) ciliates per ﬁsh and day. However, although we detected the consumption of Stentor by ﬁsh, the daily consumption amounted to at most 0.2\% of the ﬁsh biomass which can not cover the energy requirement of the ﬁsh. Furthermore, the daily consumption was equivalent to a maximum of 1.6\% of the Stentor standing stock so that ﬁsh predation does not seem to be an important mortality factor for the ciliates. The clearance rate of Stentor sp. on natural bacteria was on average 3.8 ml cilÀ1 hÀ1. The daily ingestion (mean 3.9 ng C cilÀ1 dÀ1) was about 3.5\% of the individual biomass of Stentor sp. Therefore, bacteria ingestion might explain a ciliate growth rate of appr. 1\% dÀ1, which was about 17\% of the photosynthesis of endosymbiotic algae. The maximum density of Stentor sp. in the lake could ingest about 1 mg C LÀ1 dÀ1 bacteria which is only 3\% of average bacterial production. Thus, grazing by Stentor sp. does not seem to be a main loss factor for the bacteria.},

Piecewise linear regression of published data shows for the ﬁrst time that lacustrine ﬁsh biomass increases with total phosphorus (TP) concentration in the water column up to around 140 lgÆTPÆl)1 but levels off above that value, suggesting that ﬁsh contribute less to nutrient recycling as lake productivity increases. The results conﬁrm previous ﬁndings that water column nutrient recycling by ﬁsh is much less important than by plankton and that ﬁsh are important nutrient stores in lakes. The contribution of ﬁsh to nutrient recycling is small because of their low turnover rates relative to other taxa.},

This study focused on water-sediment interface systems and explored implicit indications of lake chemistry on water P based on a case study of Baiyangdian Lake, North China. 20 variables from 14 sampling sites collected for six months in two years were investigated, including sequentially extracted P fractions. Exploratory data analysis with multivariate statistical techniques and the index of P maximum solubilization potential were employed to examine interactions of water P and coexisting chemicals, and to accomplish pattern recognition of water-sediment interface systems. Results showed that nine key variables (temperature, conductivity, ammonium nitrogen, total nitrogen, sediment total P, metallic oxide bound P, organic P, aluminum and ferrum) were identiﬁed and ranked into four latent parameters (physical factors, nutrients, P species, and metals), accounting for 81\% of water P variation. Accordingly, the recognized three patterns of water-sediment interface unraveled spatial partitioning for the domination of external or internal P sources. Four variables (temperature, sediment total P, metallic oxide bound P and organic P) were competent to classify patterns of water-sediment interface with 100\% correct assignment of cases. Using two parameters (organic P and metallic oxide bound P), discriminant functions produced 85.7\% correct assignations, indicating the importance of the two P species in explaining spatial heterogeneity of water P under oxic and alkaline circumstances. This study provides an operational zoning frame and implications for eutrophication management applicable to freshwater shallow lakes.},

Therefore, this article reviews the current state-of-knowledge on PPCPs in the freshwater aquatic environment. The environmental risk posed by these contaminants is evaluated in light of the persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity criteria. Available literature on the sources, transport and degradation of PPCPs in the aquatic environment are evaluated, followed by a comprehensive review of the reported concentrations of different PPCP groups in the freshwater aquatic environment (water, sediment and biota) of the ﬁve continents. Finally, future perspectives for research on PPCPs in the freshwater aquatic environment are discussed in light of the identiﬁed research gaps in current knowledge.

The HAB coincided with a strong El Niño event and the positive phase of the Southern Annular Mode that altered the atmospheric circulation in southern South America and the adjacent Pacific Ocean. This led to very dry conditions and higher than normal solar radiation reaching the surface. Using time series of atmospheric, hydrologic and oceanographic data we show here that an increase in surface water temperature and reduced freshwater input resulted in a weakening of the vertical stratification in the fjords and sounds of this region. This allowed the advection of more saline and nutrient-rich waters, ultimately resulting in an active harmful algal bloom in coastal southern Chile.},

	abstract = {Background: Pervasive introductions of non-native taxa are behind processes of homogenization of various types affecting the global flora and fauna. Chile’s freshwater ecosystems encompass a diverse and highly endemic fish fauna that might be sensitive to the introduction of non-native species, an ongoing process that started two centuries ago, but has to date received little attention. Using historical (native) and present-day (native and non-native) presence-absence data sets of compositional similarity, our goal was twofold: (1) evaluate patterns of taxonomic homogenization at various spatial scales and (2) identify clusters of widely versus narrowly distributed species to assess their relative role in compositional changes. We expect that non-native species with wide distributions might have a larger influence in taxonomic homogenization than those with narrow distributions.
Results: Chile’s fish assemblages have become increasingly homogenized during the last two centuries when evaluating changes in compositional similarity among 201 watersheds (65.3 \% of total comparisons showed homogenization) distributed among six defined biotic units. Taxonomic differentiation was significantly more prevalent than taxonomic homogenization within biotic units. Among biotic units, comparisons between historical and current compositional similarity were all significantly different. We identified one cluster of non-native fishes that were distributed across the entire five or six biotic units. This cluster included Brown Trout (Salmo trutta) and Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) as the two most representative species. A second cluster we identified included fishes such that on average spanned only one or two biotic units.
Conclusions: We provide first evidence for an ongoing and large-scale process of taxonomic homogenization among Chile’s watersheds occurring at various scales. Our findings provide taxonomic and biogeographic baseline information for management plans and courses of action for conservation of native fishes, many of which are endemic. We also discuss management guidelines of non-native fishes in Chile. Baseline information of both native and non-native fish taxa might be applicable to other isolated regions elsewhere.},

	abstract = {Human activities in watersheds have resulted in huge accumulations of phosphorus (P) in sediments that have subsequently hindered restoration efforts of lake water quality managers worldwide. Much controversy exists about the factors that control the release of P from sediments (internal P loading). One of the main debates concerns the role of oxygen deﬁcit (anoxia) in the regulation of water quality. Our results based on a comprehensive set of lakes worldwide demonstrate that internal P loading (IPtot) plays a signiﬁcant role in water quality regulation. Internal P loading due to anoxia (IPanox) contributes signiﬁcantly to the IPtot. However, this contribution is insufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly increase the chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentration in stratifying lakes. In the lakes of the north temperate and boreal zone, this is because the IPanox reaches surface water layer in the end of the growing season. Observed water quality implications of IPtot are most likely caused by the sedimentary P that actually originates from the shallow areas. These ﬁndings suggest limitations for the use of aeration (improvement of the oxygen conditions in the hypolimnion) in lake water quality restoration. Moreover, lake ecosystem managers can beneﬁt from our model that enables to predict anoxia triggered sedimentary P release from the combination of lake characteristics. The ﬁnal decision on the use of aeration is indeed unique to each lake, and lake speciﬁc targets should be considered.},

Water and communities associated were sampled at two sites, one in an area with the predominance of Eichhornia azurea (Sw.) Kunth and the other with the predominance of Salvinia auriculata Aublet. Communities associated with macrophytes were sampled with floating quadrants (0.5 m2); the macrophytes were washed and plankton and macrofauna were fixated with 4\% formalin and 1\% lugol iodine; the specimens were then identified and counted. Plankton and macrofauna communities associated with S. auriculata and E. azurea had a similar diversity of species but different (p{\textless}0.05) in the abundance of associated organisms. Eichhornia azurea had the highest contents in dry and wet weight, total phosphorus, total nitrogen and organic matter. Planktonic algae were directly correlated with biomass of E. azurea. The taxa with highest densities were Rotifera and Zygnematophyceae. Results showed that the environmental variables associated with macrophytes presence in the shallow reservoir is a strong predictor of favourable conditions to maintain great diversity plankton community and macrofauna associated with plants. The role of macrophytes is important for not only stabilising the clear-water state and maintaining high diversity of organisms associated, but also it seems to be a good alternative to maintaining desirable water-supply quality for aquaculture farms.},

Phytoplanktonic algae are important in water quality assessment reflecting ecossystem dynamics. Our main purpose was to study the seasonal variation of the phytoplankton community and its relations with physical and chemical parameters of the water and coliforms from Lago das Garças (Instituto de Botânica, São Paulo, SP, Brazil). The samples for the study of the physical and chemical parameters and phytoplankton analyses were collected monthly (January 1997 to March 1998) in three depths (surface, 2 m and bottom). The phytoplankton community was studied taking into account the biomass (chlorophyll-a), density and biological index. The phytoplankton was represented by 214 taxa distributed in nine taxonomic classes. Chemical parameters showed vertical and seasonal distribution whereas the phytoplankton presented a seasonal pattern; four species of Cyanobacteria were dominant mostly in the summer (Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii (Woloszynska) Seenayya \& Subba Raju, Sphaerocavum brasiliense M.T.P.

The sampling was conducted during April (spring), August (summer), October (autumn) and January (winter) of 2011–2012. Salinity, Chlorophyll a (Chl a) and DOC showed large spatial and seasonal variation during sampling period. DOC increased with increasing Chl a in spring, summer and autumn and decreased with increasing salinity in summer compared to other seasons. Maximum surface concentration of DOC ranged from 108.0 to 875.2 lM and minimum from 134.4 to 184.7 lM was found during summer and spring, respectively. Terrestrial input, phytoplankton and seaweed were the main sources of DOC in SGB. Shellﬁsh farming area was enriched in organic matter as well as served to reduce DOC levels in the bay. As it was indicated that average annual removal of 42 \% DOC occurred in the shellﬁsh, the lowest occurred at an average 32 \% in combined shellﬁsh and seaweed culture area. Additionally, controlled experiment results showed that seaweed produced approximately 64.81 ± 40.86 lM day-1 and shellﬁsh generated approximately 13.36 ± 6.07 lM day-1 and assimilated 17.07 ± 13.12 lM day-1 DOC in SGB. Accumulation of DOC at the bottom could be a result of long-term aquaculture activities in the bay. Integration of sea cucumber into IMTA system could be useful to mitigate the stockpile of organic matter at the bottom.},

One of the main strategies adopted by management and regulatory agencies is the use of hydrodynamic models that calculate the carrying or nutrient load capacity of a particular water body and the effect of fish farming. These models are precise in the development of optimal strategies for feeding and waste calculation. This review paper addresses this topic and describes the methodology developed for the analysis and simulation of the carrying capacity for fish production, based on the integration of the Fish‑PrFEQ nutritional bioenergetic model and the hydrodynamic model of Dillon \& Rigler. This methodology allows evaluating the real contribution of aquaculture waste and assists in the planning and management of aquaculture in these aquatic environments, besides enabling and encouraging producers and the aquaculture industry to use fish food with better nutritional quality and lower environmental impact.},

	abstract = {Further growth in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) aquaculture production is expected, and as a response to limited freshwater resources, recirculating aquaculture systems (RAS) are increasingly applied in smolt production. Knowledge of the general composition and quality of inlet-water is important for designing water-treatment to obtain optimal water quality in both ﬂow-through and RAS systems. Based on water quality surveys in Norway (96 water sources, 1999–2006) and Chile (120 water sources, 2006–2008) inlet-water quality was evaluated. Norwegian smolt production is characterized by almost exclusively utilizing surface waters as inlet-water sources, with lake inlets constituting 88\% and river inlets 12\%. This results in large seasonal variations in both temperature, and inlet-water quality. In Chile, production is based on inlet-water from groundwater wells (32\%), natural springs (40\%) and rivers (28\%). Norwegian inlet-water quality shows signiﬁcantly lower pH and buffering capacity. The content of total organic carbon and total nitrogen is generally higher in Norway, while the levels the main metals of concern, aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe), show large between-site variability in both countries. In low pH waters in Norway, the concentration of inorganic (labile) aluminium exceeds recommended level (10 mg/L) in 15\% of the samples. The Norwegian database documents highly variable production intensity in smolt production. The measured levels of carbon dioxide (CO2, 11.6 Æ 6.2 mg/L) and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN, 499 Æ 485 mg N/L) (mean Æ SD), exceed current legislative recommendations in 30\% and 10.5\% of the cases, respectively. RAS technology has the potential to improve a variable water quality if it proves reliable for the time intervals and production volumes needed. Thus, if necessary adjustments in water treatment to the local water quality are implemented, RAS production may well constitute a substantial part of smolt production in the future.},

Calculations have been carried out for 1997 and 2007, and also projections to 2017 and 2027 were obtained. Calculated emissions were 6097 and 6206 t NH3-N for 1997 and 2007, respectively. Major sources of NH3-N emissions were cattle accounting for more than 85\%, followed by horses and pigs. Farm management practices as grazing, housing, manure storage and land spreading of manure accounted for 87\%, 9\%, 3\%, and 2\%, respectively, of total annual emissions. Projections suggest that emissions could increase up to 6344 and 6516 t NH3-N for 2017 and 2027, respectively. Emissions are much lower than those reported for developed European countries. However, intensification of cattle production systems may lead to an increase of ammonia emissions which could impact the temperate forest of Southern Chile characterized by low nutrient fluxes.},

The ␦15N values of all biota were consistently higher in Moreno East basin, probably caused by a higher anthropogenic impact; however, the estimated trophic positions of ﬁsh showed no differences between basins, indicating that ﬁsh are feeding from food chains with different ␦15N baselines. Fish ␦13C values were higher in Moreno West basin but no pattern was observed for the rest of the organisms analyzed. The different hydrogeomorphic characteristics between the basins could lead to these differences in the C signatures of ﬁsh. SIAR (Stable Isotope Analysis in R) mixing model was used to study possible food sources for adult ﬁsh and the results were contrasted with published gut content analysis. According to the model, in both basins small size ﬁsh such as Small Puyen (Galaxias maculatus) and juvenile ﬁsh, had the highest relative isotopic contribution to introduced Rainbow Trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and Brook Trout (Salvelinus fontinalis), which had lower contributions from other sources such as insect larvae, decapods, and snails. On the contrary, decapods and insect larvae were isotopically more important for the native Creole Perch (Percichthys trucha) than small ﬁsh in both basins.

Here, we examined such lifecycle variation in of an introduced chinook salmon population in the Ayse n watershed, one of the largest fjord systems in NW Patagonia. The chinook salmon is the most successful invasive salmonid species in Patagonia and has recently colonized numerous Patagonian watersheds of the Paciﬁc and Atlantic Oceans. Using analyses of ﬁsh scales and otolith strontium:calcium ratios, our results suggest the presence of two distinct ecotypes in the chinook population, an ocean type and a stream type, in a 3:2 ratio. The distribution of back-calculated length at the time of emigration from river to marine habitats showed a mode of 14 cm for the ocean ecotype and 30 cm for the stream ecotype. River residence time for the ocean ecotype ranged from 1 to 10 months, while that of the stream ecotype varied between 14 and 20 months. Returning adults reproduced in riverine habitats between August and March, but reproduction by the stream ecotype was limited to the period between October and February. Our results show that exotic chinook salmon populations established in NW Patagonia present a diversity of lifehistory strategies, which seems to be as large as the ones exhibited by the species in its native distribution range and in other invaded ecosystems. Chinook salmon have successfully invaded most major rivers in Patagonia, placing priority on science and conservation related to their ecological impact.},

This major report, published as FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Technical Paper No. 627, explains the science behind the expected effects of climate change on marine and inland capture fisheries and aquaculture worldwide, and the implications for the millions of people who depend on the fisheries sector for their livelihoods and food security. The FAO Technical Paper also presents practical approaches to adaptation to assist fisheries and aquaculture operations at all scales to reduce the risks posed by climate change, and harness opportunities. The information is set in the context of poverty alleviation, and within existing policy commitments, such as United Nations Agenda 2030 and the Paris Climate Agreement. The advice in the FAO Technical Paper on adaptations is also firmly embedded in reality – it acknowledges the interactions within the sector, the relationships between fisheries and aquaculture and with other sectors, and the influence of other important drivers such as population growth and global demand for fish. In this article, we highlight the vulnerability assessments made for industrial tuna fisheries and small-scale coastal fisheries in the western and central Pacific Ocean, the relevance of this work to Pacific Island countries and territories, and to the ‘Regional roadmap for sustainable Pacific fisheries’ and the ‘New song for coastal fisheries – pathways to change’. We also summarise the key messages from other chapters of the FAO Technical Paper relevant to the Pacific Islands region, including the chapters on freshwater fisheries and aquaculture.},

	abstract = {This paper estimates annual P emission to the Jaguaribe River estuary, NE Brazil, responsible for approximately 30\% of the country’s farmed shrimp production. Emissions increased three times between 2001 and 2006 and reached 43.9 t.year–1. These emissions make aquaculture the third main source of P for this estuary and are much smaller than emissions from agricultural sources and slightly lower than emissions from wastewater. Their relative contribution also increased from 10.5\% to 20.5\%. Temporal variability of P concentrations in estuarine bottom sediments also suggest an increase, but not as evident as the emissions. The spatial distribution and speciation of P (total P and inorganic P) in sampling stations located upstream and downstream from the main aquaculture area confirmed the importance of this source. Inorganic P was the dominant form present in sediments downstream and showed an increase from 67\% to 75\% of the total P present in the sediment.},

	abstract = {In order to support management decisions for aquaculture, a modeling tool capable of simulating the ecosystem response was developed and is presented here. The impact on the Pagasitikos gulf ecosystem from two marine ﬁsh farms, one in a well protected cove and one in a more exposed area of the gulf, is explored and analyzed in the framework of the INSEA EU project. Model results show little effects of nutrient inputs near the exposed site. It appears that efﬂuents from the exposed site may affect more distant areas due to hydrodynamic transport, while effects in the well protected site are more localized and intense (hot spot). Additionally, as the system dynamics are driven to large extent by the seasonal physical variability, the effect depends not only on the location of the farm but also on the season. Planning decisions for coastal areas require integrated management policies based on holistic approaches that include as many system components as possible. The tool capabilities illustrated by the simulation results demonstrate its role in supporting management decisions.},

	abstract = {The need to ensure future food security and issues of varying estuarine water quality is driving the expansion of aquaculture into near-shore coastal waters. It is prudent to fully evaluate new or proposed aquaculture sites, prior to any substantial ﬁnancial investment in infrastructure and staﬃng. Measurements of water temperature, salinity and dissolved oxygen can be used to gain insight into the physical, chemical and biological water quality conditions within a farm site, towards identifying its suitability for farming, both for the stock species of interest and for assessing the potential risk from harmful or toxic algae. The latter can cause closure of shellﬁsh harvesting. Unfortunately, commercial scientiﬁc monitoring systems can be cost prohibitive for small organisations and companies to purchase and operate. Here we describe the design, construction and deployment of a low cost ({\textless} £ 5000) monitoring buoy suitable for use within a near-shore aquaculture farm or bathing waters. The mooring includes a suite of sensors designed for supporting and understanding variations in near-shore physical, chemical and biological water quality. The system has been designed so that it can be operated and maintained by non-scientiﬁc staﬀ, whilst still providing good quality scientiﬁc data. Data collected from two deployments totalling 14 months, one in a coastal bay location, another in an estuary, have illustrated the robust design and provided insight into the suitability of these sites for aquaculture and the potential occurrence of a toxin causing algae (Dinophysis spp.). The instruments maintained good accuracy during the deployments when compared to independent in situ measurements (e.g. RMSE 0.13–0.16 °C, bias 0.03–0.08 °C) enabling stratiﬁcation and biological features to be identiﬁed, along with conﬁrming that the waters were suitable for mussel (Mytilus spp.) and lobster (Homarus gammarus) aquaculture, whilst sites showed conditions agreeable for Dinophysis spp.},

	abstract = {Element determination in plankton is important for the assessment of metal contamination of aquatic environments. Until recently, it has been difﬁcult to determine elemental content in rotifers or ciliates derived from natural plankton samples because of the difﬁculty in handling and separation of these fragile organisms. The aim of this study was to evaluate methods for separation of rotifers and large ciliates from natural plankton samples (μg range dry weight) and subsequent analysis of their elemental content using total-reﬂection X-ray ﬂuorescence spectrometry (TXRF). Plankton samples were collected from different aquatic environments (three lakes, one river) in Chile, Argentina and Hungary. From one to eighty specimens of ﬁve rotifer species (Brachionus calyciﬂorus, Brachionus falcatus, Asplanchna sieboldii, Asplanchna sp., Philodina sp.) and four to twelve specimens of one large ciliate (Stentor amethystinus) were prepared according to the dry method originally developed for microcrustaceans, and analysed by TRXF following in situ microdigestion. Our results demonstrated that it possible to process these small and fragile organisms (individual dry mass: 0.17–9.39 μg ind-1) via careful washing and preparation procedures. We found species-dependent differences of the element mass fractions for some of the elements studied (Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Pb), especially for Cu, Fe and Mn. One large rotifer species (A. sieboldii) also showed a negative correlation between individual dry weight and the element content for Pb, Ni and Cr. We conclude that our application of the in situ microdigestion-TRXF method is suitable even for rotifers and ciliates, greatly expanding the possibilities for use of plankton in biomonitoring of metal contamination in aquatic environments.},

	abstract = {Similar to the increased number of studies on invasive plants and animals in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, many reports were recently published on the invasion of Nostocales (cyanobacteria) to freshwater environments worldwide. Invasion and proliferation of Nostocales in new habitats have the potential to signiﬁcantly alter the structure of the native community and to modify ecosystem functioning. But most importantly, they inﬂuence the water quality due to a variety of toxic compounds that some species produce. Therefore a special attention was given to the invasion and persistence of toxic cyanobacteria in many aquatic ecosystems. Here we summarize the currently published records on the invasion of two Nostocales genera, Cylindrospermopsis and Aphanizomenon, to lakes and water reservoirs in subtropical and temperate zones.These invading species possess traits thought to be common to many invasive organisms: high growth rate, high resource utilization efﬁciency and overall superior competitive abilities over native species when local conditions vary. Assuming that dispersion routes of cyanobacteria have not been changed much in recent decades, their recent establishment and proliferation in new habitats indicate changes in the environment under which they can exploit their physiological advantage over the native phytoplankton population. In many cases, global warming was identiﬁed as the major driving force for the invasion of Nostocales. Due to this uncontrollable trend, invasive Nostocales species are expected to maintain their presence in new habitats and further expand to new environments. In other cases, regional changes in nutrient loads and in biotic conditions were attributed to the invasion events.},

	abstract = {We evaluated the reductions in P loading needed to control blue-green algal blooms in Lake Mendota, Wisconsin. After developing a 21-year loading data set, we used a P mass balance model expressed as a difference equation with an annual time step indexed from mid-April. We defined and estimated a loss parameter λ as the proportion of the lake’s April P concentration lost through sedimentation and outflow during the following year. Using the distribution of annual λ’s and input loadings, we predicted the steady-state distribution of April P concentrations that would result from scenarios of altered inputs due to changes in management practices. These results were then linked to the probability of summer blue-green algal blooms. For no load reduction, the probability of a bloom ({\textgreater}2 mg algaeиL–1) on any summer day is about 60\%. This probability decreases to 20\% with a load reduction of 50\%. Our approach illustrates how managers can consider reducing the frequency of extreme events like algal blooms, which may correspond more to the public’s perception of lake water quality than average conditions.},

Four parameters were evaluated: pH, conductivity, temperature and concentration of metals in the water. The biotic indexes used for water quality assessment were the Shannon-Wiener diversity (H ') and the general diatomic index (GDI). 88 taxa were registered, distributed in seven phyla: Bacillariophyta (28), Charophyta (11), Chlorophyta (30), Cyanobacteria (15), Euglenophyta (2), Ochrophyta (1) and Miozoa (1). The most frequent phylum was Bacillariophyta (69.16\%), followed by Chlorophyta (24.26\%). Biotic indexes indicated that Yanamate, Lacsacocha, Quiulacocha and Milpo Andina were polluted while Huaroncocha waters had optimal biological quality.},

	abstract = {Background. Phytoplankton biomass is an essential parameter in aquatic ecosystems; two of the most widely used indicators for estimating phytoplankton biomass are chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) by spectrophotometry and biovolume (BV). Goals. To show how different results are when estimating phytoplankton biomass by means of the spectrophotometric and BV methods. Methods. Biomass by Chl-a and BV were estimated in four cultures of marine diatoms. For estimating BV, we used live cells and acid Lugol’s solution fixed cells. Results. Biomass values were noticeably different: the BV for Thalassiosira hispida and Skeletonema costatum underestimates ≈41\% of the biomass with respect to values obtained by spectrophotometry. In contrast, the BV for Pseudo-nitzschia sp. and Cylindrotheca closterium overestimates the biomass by 4\% and 25\%, respectively. In the case of estimated biovolume, the results indicate that fixer acid Lugol’s solution modified the size of the cell significantly in C. closterium and Pseudo-nitzschia sp.

	abstract = {Inland water phytoplankton is represented by 15 000 species worldwide, 1 025 of which are found in Mexico, almost 6.8\% of all continental algae, and 33.8\% of Mexico´s continental algae. Mexican algae belong mainly to the classes Bacillariophyceae (31.9\%), Cyanophyceae (18.24\%) and Chlorophyceae (17.4\%). Most species are cosmopolitan; others have tropical and nearctic affinities. The best represented species are found in the central and S-SE regions of the country ({\textgreater} 100). Few taxa are found in the N and NE regions ({\textless} 2). There are no studies or records from 8 northern and 4 central and S-SE states. The discovery of new species in Mexico was made by Europeans and Americans. Mexican scientists started describing species in 1933, but it was not until the late 20th and early 21rst centuries that a larger number of species was described. The survival of this important community in Mexico is threatened by the absence of information on phytoplanktonic algae, a low level of endemism, and the pollution of aquatic environments. Different phytoplankton species have been used as food supplements, antioxidants, for bioremediation and biofuels, but production in Mexico is still very limited.},

	abstract = {The presence of pharmaceuticals, including illicit drugs in aquatic systems, is a topic of environmental signiﬁcance because of their global occurrence and potential eﬀects on aquatic ecosystems and human health, but few studies have examined the ecological eﬀects of illicit drugs. We conducted a survey of several drug residues, including the potentially illicit drug amphetamine, at 6 stream sites along an urban to rural gradient in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A. We detected numerous drugs, including amphetamine (3 to 630 ng L−1), in all stream sites. We examined the fate and ecological eﬀects of amphetamine on bioﬁlm, seston, and aquatic insect communities in artiﬁcial streams exposed to an environmentally relevant concentration (1 μg L−1) of amphetamine. The amphetamine parent compound decreased in the artiﬁcial streams from less than 1 μg L−1 on day 1 to 0.11 μg L−1 on day 22. In artiﬁcial streams treated with amphetamine, there was up to 45\% lower bioﬁlm chlorophyll a per ash-free dry mass, 85\% lower bioﬁlm gross primary production, 24\% greater seston ash-free dry mass, and 30\% lower seston community respiration compared to control streams. Exposing streams to amphetamine also changed the composition of bacterial and diatom communities in bioﬁlms at day 21 and increased cumulative dipteran emergence by 65\% and 89\% during the ﬁrst and third weeks of the experiment, respectively. This study demonstrates that amphetamine and other biologically active drugs are present in urban streams and have the potential to aﬀect both structure and function of stream communities.},

The analysis of recreational fisheries has received comparatively short shrift. Recreational utility is assumed to be a function of both the quantity of fishing outings and their quality. Quality is measured by the catch rate per outing. R. C. Bishop and K. C. Samples state that theoretical work on recreational fishing is needed to provide “an adequate theoretical basis for planning empirical research” and “a conceptual framework consistent with sound economic principles to guide public debates about fisheries management polices.” An open-access bioeconomic equilibrium occurs when there is no tendency for individuals to begin or cease recreational fishing, and, at the same time, when the aggregate effort and landings generated by participating individuals is such that fishing mortality is equal to the growth of the existing stock.},

Here, we describe the role of inland waters as sentinels and integrators of the impact of humans on terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. The metabolic responses of lakes and streams (ie the rates at which these systems process carbon) are proposed as a common metric to integrate the impacts of environmental change across a broad range of landscapes. Lakes and streams transport and alter nutrients, contaminants, and energy, and store signals of environmental change from local to continental scales over periods ranging from weeks to millennia. A carefully conceived and well-integrated network that includes monitoring and experimental approaches to terrestrial-aquatic connectivity is critical to an understanding of basic ecosystem-level processes and to forecasting and mitigating future environmental impacts at the continental scale.},

	abstract = {Southern Chilean monomictic, temperate lakes are generally oligotrophic with high water transparency, low productivity and some apparent resistance to disturbances such as phosphorus additions. This paper attempts to explain low chlorophyll-a values using descriptive and experimental approaches. Three different scales are used, (a) a micro scale both in space and time, with experimental manipulations of N, P and total light in 24 enclosures in lake Llanquihue, (b) a longer time scale analysing 18 months of data in several sites within lake Llanquihue grouped as salmon farming sites, town bays and control sites, and (c) a broader time scale (9 years) by monitoring lakes Puyehue, Rupanco and Llanquihue, all in the Araucanian lake region and Yelcho lake in the north Patagonian region. In the Llanquihue in-lake sampling, total phosphorus values varied between 1 and 12 µg L-1 between sites, showing marginal site effects, P = 0.09 (salmon sites had greater values), however, chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations were generally low ({\textless} 2 µg L-1) and did not show site effects. Dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) concentrations were lower than 30 µg L-1 and showed a better predictive power than Chl-a. The analysis between lakes showed the lowest mean Chl-a values in Lake Yelcho (0.7 µg L-1) and the highest in lake Puyehue (2.1 µg L-1 ). Similar patterns were found for mean total P values, however there were no clear temporal trends through the 9 year sampling. The N/P molar ratio for the dissolved forms was generally below 20. In the enclosure experiment N had a positive significant effect on Chl-a concentration but neither P nor light had significant effects. Another outstanding result was that Chl-a values in the control bags were significantly higher than values in the lake. In all the lakes TN values did not exceed 20 µmol L-1 and TP did not exceed 0.8 µmol L-1 and thus N limitation could be proposed as playing an important role in regulation Chl-a and productivity. Another key-regulating factor of productivity and biomass could relate to the deep mixing which is a particular characteristic of Southern Hemisphere lakes, indeed, mixing depth has a negative effect and yields the best predictive power on Chla. This effect could also explain Chl-a increase in control bags with respect to lake since the epilimnion is artificially reduced in the former. If mixing depth influences productivity, then lake food webs should be linked to the benthos rather than to the pelagic zone particularly in the deepest mixing lakes.},

A mail survey questionnaire was sent to 697 private boat saltwater anglers in five northeastern states (62\% response, n = 419). Although recreation specialization theory predicts that more specialized participants will indicate greater support for management regulations than will less specialized participants, the authors found no significant difference in attitude toward MPAs across specialization level. Highly specialized anglers were more likely to believe that recreational harvest has a detrimental impact on fish populations than were less specialized anglers. However, the loss of access to specific fishery resources will likely be more consequential for highly specialized (more resource dependent) anglers. This greater resource dependency may have counterbalanced their general tendency to show more support for regulations as compared to less specialized anglers. Incorporation of specialization theory into attitude research can improve the understanding of important cognitive differences that exist among diverse recreation participants. Implications for specialization theory and natural resource management are discussed.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148–156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

In this paper, a hybrid model STL-VMD-SFO-ESN which combines seasonal adjustment method (STL), variational mode decomposition (VMD), echo state network (ESN) and sailed fish optimizer (SFO) is proposed for daily runoff prediction. Daily runoff data from three different runoff monitoring stations in China’s Yellow River basin is used to evaluate the performance of proposed model and other newly reported models. The results indicates that: (1) The proposed model performs significantly better than the traditional data-driven models and some newly reported models. (2) STL decomposition can effectively remove the seasonal component of runoff and improve modeling accuracy. (3) ESN has a strong potential in runoff prediction, and its performance can be greatly improved by using bio-optimization algorithms. Thus, this new model has strong potential for runoff prediction for further application.},

The primary inflows are precipitation, runoff and regulated water additions. The main outflows are evaporation, seepage, overflow after storms and intentional discharge. Water conservation measures such as maintaining storage capacity in ponds equal to the normal, maximum daily precipitation, reduction in seepage beneath dams and through pond bottoms, fish harvest without draining ponds, and water re-use are discussed. Even with the implementation of water conservation measures, pond aquaculture is a water- intensive endeavour which consumes more water per unit of area than irrigated agriculture. However, the value of aquacultural production per unit of water used greatly exceeds that of irrigated agriculture. Reduction in effluent volume is the most effective water saving means, and not only reduces water consumption but also reduces the pollution potential of pond aquaculture.},

	abstract = {Motivated by recent extreme flow events in the Mataquito River located in the Mediterranean region of Chile, we performed a detailed trend analysis of critical hydroclimatic variables based on observed daily flow, precipitation and temperature within the basin. For the period 1976–2008, positive trends in temperature were observed, especially during spring and summer months. At the same time, we found negative trends in the frequency and intensity of precipitation, especially during spring months. We observed an increasing difference between average streamflow in the rainy season as compared to the snowmelt season. Part of this trend is caused by larger flows during autumn months, although no positive precipitation trends are observed for these months. Finally, significant reductions in minimum flow during spring/summer and a disproportionate concentration of high-flow events occurring in the last 10 years were also identified. These high-flow events tend to happen during autumn months, and are associated with high precipitation and high minimum temperatures. Based on a simple assessment of changes in irrigated agriculture and land use, we concluded that other non-climatic factors seem not to be as relevant to the detected flow trends. All these results are in accord with future climate change scenarios that show an increase in temperature, a reduction in average precipitation and a reduction in snow accumulation. Such future scenarios could seriously hamper the development of economic activities in this basin, exemplifying also a fate that may be shared by other similar basins in Chile and in other regions of the world.

	abstract = {General circulation models (GCMs) allow the analysis of potential changes in the climate system under different emissions scenarios. However, their spatial resolution is too coarse to produce useful climate information for impact/adaptation assessments. This is especially relevant for regions with complex orography and coastlines, such as in Chile. Downscaling techniques attempt to reduce the gap between global and regional/local scales; for instance, statistical downscaling methods establish empirical relationships between large-scale predictors and local predictands. Here, statistical downscaling was employed to generate climate change projections of daily maximum/minimum temperatures and precipitation in more than 400 locations in Chile using the analog method, which identifies the most similar or analog day based on similarities of large-scale patterns from a pool of historical records. A cross-validation framework was applied using different sets of potential predictors from the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis following the perfect prognosis approach. The best-performing set was used to downscale six different CMIP5 GCMs (forced by three representative concentration pathways, RCPs). As a result, minimum and maximum temperatures are projected to increase in the entire Chilean territory throughout all seasons. Specifically, the minimum (maximum) temperature is projected to increase by more than 2 °C (6 °C) under the RCP8.5 scenario in the austral winter by the end of the twenty-first century. Precipitation changes exhibit a larger spatial variability. By the end of the twenty-first century, a winter precipitation decrease exceeding 40\% is projected under RCP8.5 in the central-southern zone, while an increase of over 60\% is projected in the northern Andes.},

Thus, a surface temperature analysis at different temporal scales is important, as this parameter influences the physical, chemical, and biological cycles of lakes. Here, we analyze monthly, seasonal, and annual surface temperature trends in south central Chilean lakes during the 2000–2016 period, using MODIS satellite imagery. To this end, 14 lakes with a surface area greater than 10 km2 were examined. Results show that 12 of the 14 lakes presented a statistically significant increase in surface temperature, with a rate of 0.10 °C/decade (0.01 °C/year) over the period. Furthermore, some of the lakes in the study present a significant upward trend in surface temperature, especially in spring, summer, and winter. In general, a significant increase in surface water temperature was found in lakes located at higher altitudes, such as Maule, Laja and Galletué lakes. These results contribute to the provision of useful data on Chilean lakes for managers and policymakers.},
